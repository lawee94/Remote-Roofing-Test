## Reflection

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router , Redux, axios and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. Also i choose redux purposely to manage the state of react component such as the error state, loading state and the content gotten from API JSON Feed using axios.

The improvement that can be made to this project are: <br />
    1.  Adding a detail page showing description about each movie or series <br />
    2.  Adding authentication. <br />
    3.  Functionality of adding movie or series to a watchlist, favourite or playlist. <br />
    4.  Adding pagination
